                <h1>Cats Patch 1.01</h1>
                <p>Kittens, with murder mittens. They are <em>ferocious</em> little <span class="fury"><strong>fury</strong></span> fluffs. We've heard the feedback and as such we feel it's order to tune some of the cat's stats & abilities!</p>
                <div class="cat-list"><p>A cat has many things it excels at, such as:
            
                    <ul>
                    <li>Hunting</li>
                    <li>Jumping</li>
                    <li>Slicing</li>
                    <li>World Domination</li>
                    <li>And of course <strong>Sleeping</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="cat-list">We felt like cats were too dominant all across the board so we've made some changes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduced jump height by ~17% (now 2m, previously 2,4m). Cats had too much agility so we're trying to tone it down a bit.</li>
                        <li>Nail sharpness reduced by 5%.</li>
                        <li>Nails have a small delay before deploying.</li>
                        <li>Removed: <em>Irritate Slash:</em> Nails no longer makes skin swell upon getting scratched by the death claws.</li>
                        <li>Love bites tendencies increased by 12% (We'll be monitoring this one)</li>
                        <li>To make cats feel more balanced and consistent we've also reduced laziness by 40%.</li>
                    </ul>
